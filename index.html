            <div class="first-phrase">As most know, Bees are the very important to the entire ecosystem. Some might even say the very backbone of the whole world. As a refresher, I would like to go over the <u>Importance of Bees.</u></div>
            <div class="second-phrase">Bees are important to people and the planet in many ways. The following is a list of just the many ways that Bees, although tiny, are mighty for the ecosystem.</div>

            <div class="sad">Most people can agree that bees are super important to the environment and ecosystem. However, there are some who could care less about their importance. Bees, and other pollinators, such as butterflies, bats, and hummingbirds, are increasinly under threat from human activies.</div>
            <div class="air-pollution">Despite human activies, there are other ways bees are being threatened. Air pollution is thought to be affecting bees. Preliminary research shows that air pollutants interact with different scent molecules released by plants, which bees need to locate food. Because of the interacting of different air pollutants, this makes foraging for bees more difficult. Thus making them slower and less effective at pollination.</div>
            <div class="breeding">Another way bees are being threatend is mass breeding. While the vast majority of pollinators are wild, including more than 20,000 different species of bees, mass breeding and large-scale transportation of pollinators can pose risks by also spreading different pathogens and parasites.</div>

                <p class="card-text">Bees are essential pollinators that allow plants to reproduce by transporting pollen from flower to flower. This process fertilizes plants so they can grow and produce food, and is responsible for at least 30% of the world's food production. In the United States alone, bees pollinate an estimated $10 billion in crops each year.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Bees help maintain biodiversity by improving the diversity of plant species, which in turn affects the variety of insects and animals in an ecosystem. They also support forest regeneration.</p>
