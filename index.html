    <h1 class="intro">Bees, Carrying the <span class="span">World</span> on Their Shoulders.</h1>

    <div class="first-phrase">As most know, Bees are the very important to the entire ecosystem. Some might even say the very backbone of the whole world. As a refresher, I would like to go over the <u>Importance of Bees.</u></div>
    <div class="second-phrase">Bees are important to people and the planet in many ways. The following is a list of just the many ways that Bees, although tiny, are mighty for the ecosystem.</div>

    <ul class="list">
        <li>Pollination</li>
        <p>Bees are essential pollinators that allow plants to reproduce by transporting pollen from flower to flower. This process fertilizes plants so they can grow and produce food, and is responsible for at least 30% of the world's food production. In the United States alone, bees pollinate an estimated $10 billion in crops each year.</p>
        <li>Biodiversity</li>
        <p>Bees help maintain biodiversity by improving the diversity of plant species, which in turn affects the variety of insects and animals in an ecosystem. They also support forest regeneration.</p>
        <li>Soil Health</li>
        <p>When bees visit flowers, they spread pollen and nectar, which can help improve soil microbial activity and nutrient cycling.</p>
        <li>Food</li>
        <p>Bees produce high-quality food like honey, royal jelly, and pollen, as well as other products like beeswax, propolis, and honey bee venom.</p>
    </ul>
